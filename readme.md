<h1>PHP Login System</h1>
<br>
This version is updating Mysqli and included Boostrap.<br>
I appreciate the development of Ivan and idea of jpmaster77.<br>
<br>
I wanted to do something good for the community by putting this up
on GitHub.&nbsp; The code is several years old, first published in
2004 by jpmaster77.&nbsp; This code has been particularly useful to
me and many others as referenced by the 44 pages of comments this
script has now and is still receiving two or three comments per day
(5 years later!).<br>
<br>
Hopefully people will view this as useful. My goal is to try to
develop this free resource by updating the code and adding useful
features.<br>
<br>
I will answer any questions you all may have to the best of my
ability.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Jose Mantilla<br>
